        <h1>In this project i experimented with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies) neural networks and recreated the (in)famous Flappy Bird game as all images and other 
          assets were free to use and i always wanted to finally "beat the game" and learn about Artificial Intelligence.   </h1>

        <p> I have absolutely did not develop nothing related to the algorithm itself. The great researchers at the University of Texas provided the python module needed for evolving the neural networks. What i have done is develop 
          the game mechanics and then piped the bird class into a function that automates and processes the game physics input to evolve the different generations of genes, resulting in the survival of
          the fitest and the one elite generation that has evolved to the maximum and thus cannot evolve further. </p>

        <p>The rate of development depends on compuing power as well as fitness level configurations. I am planning to recreate it with Google Chrome's offline T-Rex game in the near future. </p>
