        <h1>In this project with Unity i decided to build an Android app using Vuforia 8 engine, a 20EUR bill and a free polygon figure of Donald Trump.</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="unity" src="../img/Screenshot (124).png">
        <p>The intention was to use Android's Augmented Reality capabilities to experiment with this technology and learn how to implement it in my future designs. The 20EUR bill serves as an anchor
         for the Vuforia engine to detect<br> with the phone camera, on top of the anchor i have placed mini Trump (did it for the memes) and when Vuforia identifies the anchor which has previously had
         to be updated to their cloud database in order to synchronize with Unity, it renders the polygon figure's x-y-z coordinates on top of the anchor by processing the gyroschopes data when moving around the anchor.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="vuforia" src="../img/vuforia.jpeg">
        <p>The result is an app that can generate a 3D image of mini-Trump on top of the anchor image by identifying the characteristics of the defined anchor. </p>
