        <h1> I had the opportunity to develop several websites for small clients the first one is an independent artist who was looking for business exposure. </h1>

        <img class="maroz" src="../img/maroz.png">
        <p> 
          For this artist's request i took care of the landing page as simple as she requested it with a painting of hers in the background. </p>
        <br>
        <img class="maroz-2" src="../img/maroz-2.png">
        <p>Then created a simple yet clean burguer menu to allow users to navigate her website. The rest of the pages have been developed by someone else therefore i will not go through them.</p>

        <img class="hotel" src="../img/hotel.png">
        <p>Another project has been developing a proof of concept for a guest house who did not need any kind of complicated logic, just a simple and static web page 
          to inform their potential customers and capture tourists speniding vacation days in the city. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="hotel-2" src="../img/hotel-2.png">
        <p>As per request the interface is clean and simple with just enough information to please the user who wants an overview of the guest house they will book a room in. </p>
